Correct Gui 1/1

Comment Header 2/2

Code comments 1/1

Correct results 1/2 RLC error (use Farads &amp; Henries)

my example H = 0.47, F = 0.00001, R = 2000, gave these answers:


Center frequency = 73.4Hz
Series bandwidth = 677Hz
Series Q factor = 0.108

For RC errors in result (use Farads - easier)
